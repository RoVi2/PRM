THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE

1) randomConfiguration()
When it fails to find a configuration, something needs to be output

2) Locate and delete the "small" unconnected trees that remains after the construction and expansion phases.
---> it can be suggested as an improvement for the algorithm to output a completely connected PRM (only one tree instead of several)

3) candidateNighbours 
Fix the priority queue (I thinks is not shorting the nodes by distance)--> check class Metrics()

4) Finish the learning phase (construction step): define for a specific robot and workspace the density of nodes that we want 
total number of nodes/WS volume and finish when it is reached

5) Put everything in the plug-in once it's done
